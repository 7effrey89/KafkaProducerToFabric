# KafkaProducerToFabric

C# Console code sample of how to sent events to Microsoft Fabric.

The application is sample code of a typical Kafka Producer where the only change to the code has been modifying it to point towards the Microsoft Fabric endpoint instead of a Kafka Cluster.

The application is sending mocked telemetry data of a router.
